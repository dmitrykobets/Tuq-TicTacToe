# Tuq-TicTacToe

 - Made using Java JFrames/JComponents
 - the UI is custom made, and relies on a tile-based layout, so visually it's not great, but the logic behind it makes it 
 possible to play on on any-sized board, with minimal tweaking of code
  - the only visual glitch could happen is with very small game-board sizes, since the text-size does not get adjusted
 - To check for a win, only iterate through rows/columns/diagonals which contain the player, eliminating needless checks
